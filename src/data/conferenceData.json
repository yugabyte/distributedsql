Given its flexible nature, Airflow is used to interact with everything from legacy on-prem systems to distributed, Kubernetes-native applications. As organizations undergo digital transformations, users responsible for data workloads are often tasked with coordinating these legacy and cloud native systems concurrently. The growing number and complexity of these workloads causes teams to require standardization layer around for maintainability, reusability, and extendability.\n\nThis talk will showcase how data platform engineers can provide a standard template for users to perform business-specific actions with Apache Airflow to replicate Postgres data to a distributed Yugabyte instance. It will end with a brief overview of the Airflow Provider framework."

The consequences of applying changes too slowly or, worse, breaking something at internet-scale are just too high.\n\nFortunately, we can learn from lessons the DevOps movement have taught us. DevOps practitioners have been dealing with internet-scale applications for some time and we can apply what they've learned to the database to ultimately allow teams to operate safely at internet-scale while still meeting business expectations for internet speed when delivering new functionality.\n\nThis session will discuss:\n<ul>\n<li>The challenges of schema management in a distributed SQL database</li>\n<li>Balancing those challenges with delivery speed and safety</li>\n<li>Example workflows using Liquibase to perform schema updates on a distributed SQL database</li></ul>"

      "description": "GraphQL subscriptions are seeing broader adoption in building event-driven microservices. Popular GraphQL servers achieve subscriptions through live queries. Live queries are nothing but querying the backing database at a fixed time interval. Obviously, as the number of subscriptions increases, it increases the query load on the database. Any other DML operations on a database will strain the resources of the monolithic single-node database.\n\nIn this talk, we will walk through steps for implementing resilient and scalable GraphQL subscriptions using Hasura Engine and YugabyteDB on Kubernetes. Components of the stack, including the database, can be linearly scaled independently of each other. In addition to linear scalability, GraphQL subscriptions will inherently become resilient against outages due to the fault tolerance and HA capabilities of distributed SQL databases."
